# EC710--Graduate-Level_Dynamic_Programming_and_Reinforcement_Learning
## Course Description

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on learning from repeated interactions with an environment. It forms the basis of state-of-the-art algorithms for playing strategy games such as **Chess, Go, Backgammon, and Starcraft**, as well as applications in **robotics, operations research, and engineering**.  

In this course, we will study the **fundamental algorithms of reinforcement learning**, aiming to understand the **mathematical principles** behind them and to test them on several popular benchmarks.  

⚠️ *Note: This class will be math-heavy.*  

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge of fundamentals of probability and linear algebra.
